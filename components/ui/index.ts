/**
 * üåà shadcn/ui Component Library Index
 * 
 * This file exports all the UI components for the Golden Bear Daycare website.
 * Think of it like a table of contents for all our beautiful components!
 * 
 * What this does for kids:
 * This is like having one big toy box where you can find all your favorite toys
 * organized and ready to play with! Instead of looking in many different boxes,
 * you can find everything you need in one place.
 * 
 * For grown-ups:
 * Centralized export file for all shadcn/ui components, making imports cleaner
 * and more manageable across the application. Each component is fully typed
 * with TypeScript and includes comprehensive documentation.
