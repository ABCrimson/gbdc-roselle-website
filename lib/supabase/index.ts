/**
 * üìö SUPABASE LIBRARY MAIN ENTRANCE
 * 
 * Think of this file as the "front desk" or "main lobby" of a big building!
 * Instead of having to remember which floor each office is on, you just come
 * to the front desk and ask for what you need.
 * 
 * What does this file do?
 * - Collects ALL our Supabase tools from different files
 * - Organizes them in one convenient place
 * - Makes it easy to import exactly what you need
 * - Provides a single "shopping list" of available tools
 * 
 * Why is this useful?
 * ‚úÖ Instead of: import { createClient } from './supabase/client'
 *                import { useAuth } from './supabase/hooks'  
 *                import { uploadFile } from './supabase/utils'
 * 
 * ‚úÖ You can do: import { createClient, useAuth, uploadFile } from './supabase'
 * 
 * It's like having a universal remote control instead of separate remotes
 * for your TV, cable box, sound system, and lights!
 * 
 * What's available in our toolbox?
 * üîå Clients: Different ways to connect to Supabase
 * ü™ù Hooks: React superpowers for components
 * üõ†Ô∏è Utils: Helpful tools and utilities
 * üöÄ Edge Functions: Cloud helper services
 * ‚öôÔ∏è Config: Settings and configuration
 * üõ°Ô∏è Middleware: Behind-the-scenes authentication helpers
 * 
 * @version Supabase 2.57.4 (your one-stop shop for all Supabase needs)
