 * has all the settings for how our app talks to Supabase (our online database).
 * 
 * What is Supabase?
 * Supabase is like a super-powered online filing cabinet that can:
 * - Store information (like user accounts, photos, documents)
 * - Send emails automatically
 * - Handle payments
 * - Keep things secure
 * - Update information in real-time (like a live chat)
 * 
 * This file sets up all the "rules" and "addresses" so our app knows:
 * - Where to find our online database
 * - How to connect securely
 * - What special functions are available
 * - How to organize different types of files
 * 
 * Version: Using Supabase 2.57.4 (like version 2.57.4 of a video game)
 * Pattern: Edge Functions v2 (the newest way to run special tasks)

 * - Your email settings (so it can send messages)
 * - Your security preferences (so strangers can't access your stuff)
 * 
 * Every part of our app will use these settings to know how to work properly.
