/**
 * üõ†Ô∏è SUPABASE UTILITY TOOLBOX
 * 
 * Think of this file as a super helpful toolbox full of useful tools!
 * Just like how a toolbox has different tools for different jobs
 * (hammer for nails, screwdriver for screws, etc.), this file has
 * different functions to help with common Supabase tasks.
 * 
 * What kinds of tools are in here?
 * üîß Connection Tools: Check if we can talk to Supabase
 * üîÑ Retry Tools: Try again if something fails  
 * üì¶ Batch Tools: Do lots of things at once efficiently
 * üìÑ Pagination Tools: Show data page by page (like a book)
 * üìÅ File Tools: Upload, download, and manage files
 * ‚ö° Performance Tools: Make things faster and more reliable
 * 
 * Why do we need these tools?
 * - Make our code easier to write and understand
 * - Handle common problems automatically
 * - Make the website faster and more reliable
 * - Provide helpful error messages when things go wrong
 * - Follow best practices for database operations
 * 
 * Think of it like:
 * Having a Swiss Army knife instead of carrying around individual tools!
 * Everything you commonly need is in one convenient place.
 * 
 * @version Supabase 2.57.4 (latest tools for the latest Supabase version)

 * - It's a simple, lightweight operation
 * - Every app has users, so the table should exist
 * - We only ask for one ID, so it's super fast
 * - It tests both connection AND database access
